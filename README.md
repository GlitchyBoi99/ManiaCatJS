ManiaCat written in JS!
WHAT!?

Has resizing and dragging and saves your settings in localStorage! :)
Useful if you're working on an offline web game or something

Make sure you download it from the releases

(Note that the online demo has to load the hand images a little bit so just be patient (you'll have to use it for a little bit))
